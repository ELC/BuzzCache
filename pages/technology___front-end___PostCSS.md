- PostCSS is a versatile and modular tool used in web development to transform [[technology/language/CSS]] stylesheets. Unlike [[technology/front-end/Sass]] and [[technology/front-end/LESS]] , PostCSS is not a preprocessor, but rather a tool that processes existing CSS files and applies transformations or enhancements using plugins. It works on a plugin-based architecture, allowing developers to choose and configure specific transformations based on their project's needs. PostCSS is highly flexible, enabling a wide range of operations, such as autoprefixing, minification, linting, and even future CSS syntax support through tools like CSSnext. With its modular design and extensive plugin ecosystem, PostCSS has gained popularity as a flexible and efficient way to enhance CSS development workflows, ultimately improving the performance and maintainability of web projects.
