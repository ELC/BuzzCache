- Babel is a popular [[technology/language/JavaScript]] compiler that translates modern ECMAScript (ES) code into backward-compatible versions, allowing developers to use the latest language features while ensuring compatibility with older browsers. It empowers developers to write code using the latest JavaScript syntax (ES6+, ESNext) without worrying about browser support. Babel also supports [[technology/frontend/JSX]] syntax used with libraries like [[technology/frontend/Framework/React]] . Through plugins, Babel can apply various transformations to the code, enabling the use of cutting-edge language features and proposals. This tool plays a significant role in modern web development, enabling developers to embrace the latest advancements in JavaScript while maintaining broad browser compatibility.
