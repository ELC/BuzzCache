- Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine built on top of Apache Lucene. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and provide lightning-fast search capabilities. Elasticsearch uses a JSON-based query language to perform complex searches and aggregations on data, making it ideal for building applications that require powerful search functionality.
- One of Elasticsearch's key features is its ability to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance, allowing it to handle large amounts of data and high query loads efficiently.
