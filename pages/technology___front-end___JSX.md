- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manipulate UI components. JSX combines the power of JavaScript with the expressiveness of HTML, allowing developers to define UI elements, component structures, and their interactions in a more intuitive manner. During the build process, JSX code is transformed into regular JavaScript using a transpiler like Babel, which makes it compatible with browsers. This seamless integration between JavaScript and JSX has contributed significantly to React's popularity and efficiency in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
