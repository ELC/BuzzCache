- PNPM is a package manager for [[technology/language/NodeJS]] applications. It stands for "Fast, disk space efficient package manager." Like npm (Node Package Manager) and [[technology/DependencyManagement/Yarn]] , pnpm manages the installation and dependency resolution of JavaScript packages required for a Node.js project. However, unlike its counterparts, pnpm takes a unique approach by employing a "shrinkwrap" file and using a single shared package store. This approach significantly reduces disk space usage by avoiding duplicate dependencies across projects. Moreover, pnpm speeds up installation and updates by creating hard links to the shared packages, rather than copying them. These features make pnpm an efficient and resource-friendly alternative for managing Node.js dependencies.
