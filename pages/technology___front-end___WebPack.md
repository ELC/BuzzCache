- Webpack is a powerful [[technology/language/JavaScript]] module bundler that optimizes and combines code and assets for web applications. It handles dependencies, supports loaders for processing various file types, and offers code-splitting for better performance. With plugins, developers can perform tasks like minification and optimization. Webpack is essential for modern web development, simplifying build processes and improving application performance.
- Through its loaders, Webpack can process and transform various types of files, such as transpiling ES6+ JavaScript to ES5 using [[technology/front-end/Babel]] , or converting [[technology/front-end/Sass]] or [[technology/front-end/LESS]] stylesheets to regular [[technology/language/CSS]] . This allows developers to use cutting-edge technologies and preprocessors while ensuring browser compatibility.
