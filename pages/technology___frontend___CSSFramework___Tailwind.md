- Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first [[technology/language/CSS]] framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-defined classes to style [[technology/language/HTML]] elements. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components, Tailwind focuses on offering a wide range of low-level utility classes. These classes can be directly applied to HTML elements to style them without writing custom CSS. Tailwind provides utilities for styling typography, colors, spacing, sizing, and more, enabling developers to rapidly build responsive and consistent user interfaces. While it may require a learning curve to master, Tailwind's flexibility and modular approach make it a powerful tool for building custom and efficient designs without compromising on performance.
