- CSS is a web development language that styles [[technology/language/HTML]] documents, controlling fonts, colors, layout, and spacing. It follows a cascading approach, inherits styles, and uses selectors for precise targeting. Responsive design techniques are supported through media queries. CSS separates content from presentation, promoting clean code and improving accessibility and user experience.
