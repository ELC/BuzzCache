- Svelte is a modern, component-based [[technology/language/JavaScript]] framework designed to build web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks, Svelte shifts the bulk of its work from runtime to build time, resulting in smaller and faster applications. With Svelte, developers write components using familiar [[technology/language/HTML]] , [[technology/language/CSS]] , and JavaScript syntax. During the build process, Svelte compiles these components into highly optimized and efficient JavaScript code. This approach eliminates the need for a large runtime library, reducing the size of the final bundle and improving the application's performance. Svelte also supports reactive programming, enabling seamless reactivity without the need for complex state management libraries. Its simplicity, performance, and developer-friendly approach make Svelte an excellent choice for building modern web applications with minimal overhead.
