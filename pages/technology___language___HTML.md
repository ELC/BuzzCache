- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, defining the structure and content of web pages. It uses markup tags to designate headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements. With HTML, developers create a hierarchical structure of content, enabling browsers to interpret and display web pages accurately. It forms the basis for building interactive websites and interfaces by embedding multimedia, forms, and scripts. HTML5, the latest version, introduces new semantic elements for enhanced accessibility and search engine optimization. Coupled with [[technology/language/CSS]] and [[technology/language/JavaScript]] , HTML empowers developers to craft engaging and dynamic websites for a seamless user experience.
