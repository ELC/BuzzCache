- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a powerful and popular [[technology/language/CSS]] preprocessor that extends the capabilities of traditional CSS. It introduces advanced features like variables, nesting, mixins, and loops, which streamline and enhance the process of writing stylesheets. With Sass, developers can define reusable code snippets using mixins and include them throughout their stylesheets. The nesting feature allows for more organized and hierarchical styling rules. Additionally, Sass supports variables, enabling easy management and quick changes to colors, fonts, and other design elements. The preprocessor's capabilities aid in maintaining cleaner and more maintainable code, ultimately saving time and effort in web development projects. After writing Sass code, it is compiled into regular CSS, which browsers can interpret and display.
