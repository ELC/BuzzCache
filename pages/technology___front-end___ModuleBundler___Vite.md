- Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool and development server for modern web development. It is specifically designed to enhance the development experience with technologies like [[technology/front-end/Framework/Vue]], [[technology/front-end/Framework/React]] , and [[technology/language/TypeScript]] . Vite leverages native ES modules to provide instant server startup and fast hot module replacement, resulting in a near-instantaneous development environment. During development, Vite compiles code on-demand and serves it directly to the browser, eliminating the need for time-consuming bundling processes. This approach significantly speeds up the development workflow and improves developer productivity. When the project is ready for production, Vite can generate optimized and production-ready builds for deployment. Its simplicity, speed, and compatibility with popular frameworks have made Vite a preferred choice for building modern web applications.
