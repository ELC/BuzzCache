- LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that serves as a [[technology/language/CSS]] preprocessor. It introduces features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions to enhance the way stylesheets are written. Developers can use variables to store values and reuse them throughout the stylesheet, making it easy to maintain consistent styles. Nesting allows for a more organized and readable code structure, while mixins enable the creation of reusable code snippets. LESS also supports mathematical operations and custom functions, providing greater flexibility in defining styles. After writing LESS code, it is compiled into standard CSS, which browsers can understand and apply to web pages. This preprocessor streamlines CSS development, making it more efficient and maintainable for complex projects.
