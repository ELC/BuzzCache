- BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention and methodology for writing [[technology/language/CSS]] in a structured and maintainable way. It organizes code by dividing UI components into self-contained "blocks," which represent standalone elements on a webpage. Each block can contain "elements" that are part of the block and "modifiers" that define variations or states. By using a strict naming scheme like "block__element--modifier," BEM ensures clear and predictable CSS classes, reducing the likelihood of style conflicts and easing collaboration among developers. This methodology enhances code reusability, scalability, and consistency, making it easier to manage complex CSS projects.
