- Ajax (Asynchronous [[technology/language/JavaScript]] and [[technology/language/XML]] ) is a web development technique that allows for real-time data retrieval and interaction without requiring a page refresh. By combining JavaScript, XML or [[technology/language/JSON]] , and server-side technologies, Ajax enables seamless data exchange between the client and server. It empowers developers to create dynamic web applications, as user actions trigger asynchronous requests to the server, updating specific parts of the page instead of reloading the entire content. This results in faster and more responsive user experiences. Ajax has become a crucial element in modern web development, facilitating interactive and interactive features like auto-suggestions, live updates, and interactive forms.
